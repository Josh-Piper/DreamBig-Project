# Prototype

There are a total of three variations first being the roadmap prototype, then the galaxy prototype then now currently the circular galaxy prototype as opposed to being continuous in the previous one.


## Roadmap prototype

DreamBig aims to provide a personalised roadmap integrated with Ontrack to support students to
develop and improve their employability after graduation. In addition, it will provide a platform to
help set realistic expectations for students graduating into the real world.


## Galaxy prototype

DreamBig will be an integrated platform with Ontrack which helps contributing to student
employability. This is important to Thoth Tech as we believe in providing educational resources for
students.

## Colours for roadmap prototype

Login

Different from the for Deakin login, being blue with a little extra visual behind. Not to be distracting, but also not too plain. So to give a fresh feel something blue I thought was good. 

Home 

This should not be too distracting for roadmap, but still be colorful enough to match in with the design. I went with colours that are considered relaxing such as pink, green, and blue. I went for a lighter theme as to better accentuate the graphics displayed on top of it whereas a darker theme would have just made it harder for readers.  I went with blue as it is usually associated as a calm color.

Edit profile 

Just a plain grey with a little extra something. When editing important details, it’s not a good idea for a distracting background. Which is why I assume most sites have a plain background too. The image can be seen above with all the variants of colors used in the prototype.
